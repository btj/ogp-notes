# Lecture 1

## Topic of the course

The official title of the course is "Object-oriented programming". However, a better title would be "Modular programming", because while you will in fact learn the Java programming language and object-oriented programming, the most important concept of the course is "Modular programming".

Modular programming is the principal method by which software
engineers manage the complexity of the task of building, maintaining, and
evolving large software systems. In this approach, a _decomposition_ of
the software system into a number of _modules_ is defined; for each
module, a clear and _abstract_ _specification_ is defined of the
syntax and semantics of the program elements or _API_ it _exports_ for use by
other modules; and each module is _implemented_ such that its
_correctness_ (that is, its _compliance_ with its specification) depends
only on the specifications, not the implementations, of the modules whose
program elements it uses (that is, whose program elements it _imports_).

This approach allows each module to be developed, understood, verified, and
evolved independently from, and in parallel with, other modules, and
therefore allows much larger and more complex software systems to be built,
maintained and evolved than would otherwise be possible.

The focus of this course will be on how to design and clearly define the syntax and semantics of module APIs. Only if APIs are well-defined can the benefits of modular programming be realized fully.

A major reason why we choose Java as the programming language for this course is that it has good support for clearly defining the syntax of APIs. In particular, it has strong static typing, and strong support for encapsulation: the compiler and virtual machine (Java's execution environment) together enforce that a module is accessed only through its official API, and that the correct number and types of arguments are passed to each API call.

Besides precisely defining the syntax of APIs, it is crucial to also precisely define their _semantics_ (meaning), in terms of the behavior generated by API calls. Therefore, in this course, we put a strong emphasis on how to write clear and comprehensive _documentation_ for APIs. For the sake of clarity and precision, we will complement informal documentation by formal specifications.

## Introduction to Java

Before we discuss the structure of the course in more detail, we introduce the core concepts of the Java programming language: values, variables, object references, arrays, classes, the call stack, and the heap, by means of a series of simple example programs. We do so using the [JLearner](https://btj.github.io/jlearner/) environment for visualizing the execution of Java code snippets.

We will discuss the structure of the course and the practicalities in the second lecture.
