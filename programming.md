# Principles of programming in Java

We introduce the core concepts of the Java programming language: values, variables, object references, arrays, classes, the call stack, and the heap, by means of a series of simple example programs. We do so using the [JLearner](https://btj.github.io/jlearner/) environment for visualizing the execution of Java code snippets.

See [The JLearner Programming Language] for a detailed description of the syntax and meaning of JLearner programs. We recommend that students study this document to acquire a precise vocabulary for discussing and reasoning about JLearner (and Java) programs and their execution.
